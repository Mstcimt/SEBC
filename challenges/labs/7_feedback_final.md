Next step would be (if more time) installing Kerberize cluster 

Feedback:

First, you both are very friendly and experienced.

I am sorry, I had completely other expectations, and I don't get exactly the sense of this bootcamp.

- First thing I learned in IT-Buisness for over 25 years: Never do something headless and in hurry! Make good preperations, a detailed time schedule and a useful working map.
- So it would be helpful to have a much better prepared training environment.
- I expected more details for expert using cloudera and installing it. So my wish would be more to participate from your excellent and deep knowledge.
- Much of the training course I could to at home in my office.
- For the most interessting thing security there was too less time, because of much trouble to get AWS environment running.
- Stress installation we have already in daily work :(, so I don't need this again when I'm doing training.

So I have to discuss this with your and my manager further to get a final point.
